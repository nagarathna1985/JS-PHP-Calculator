# JS-PHP-Calculator

A simple calculator in Javascript and PHP

I have done the JS, HTML and CSS bit. PHP bit yet to do.

Basically when clicked on the SAVE button it should save the calculation history, user IP address, date and browser to the csv file.

Then convert the data in CSV file into an array to display as a table in a new page called calculations.php

To run the project:

- git clone the repo.

- PHP needs to be installed in the system.

- Start the PHP server and go the specified localhost.
  example: If the server is running in the port 9999 the go to http://localhost:9999/www/index.php to serve the index page.

Task to do:

PHP bit needs to be completed.
